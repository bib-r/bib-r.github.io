				BIB-R Datasets: Overview
			</h1>

			<p>BIB-R is a benchmark for the interpretation of bibliographic records. It 
				provides two datasets (T42 and BIB-RCAT) dedicated to
				the evaluation of the FRBRization process. The goal T42 is 
				to identify the weak and strong points of a tool by
				testing all possible issues that libraries may face during
				FRBRization. The second dataset BIB-RCAT is extracted from catalogs
				of three different cultural institutions and can be used for
				comparing or experimenting with the data quality and size of data
				that typically is found in real world catalogs. The expected FRBR
				results (gold standard) are included in these datasets to enable
				evaluation. The MARC catalogs are provided in MARC/XML format while
				the FRBR collections are available in RDF/XML (Generated by the Jena
				API).</p>

			<h2 id="t42">
				T42
			</h2>

			<p>T42 has been built for benchmarking FRBRization solutions
				which deal with MARC records.
				The dataset is composed by 42 different tests where each relates a specific FRBR
				pattern representation and can include specific issues. 
				We provide both records in UNIMARC and MARC21. Every record comes from a real-world library catalog and has been adapted to the tests. Original records have been transformed in several steps, first in an automated way and then with a manual validation.

				BIB-RCAT
			</h2>

			<p>BIB-RCAT is a dataset of MARC21 records accompanied by a
				FRBR gold version to evaluate a FRBRization solution. The collection is bigger than T42 and records comes from real-world library catalogs.<br/>

				Getting Started
			</h2>

			<p>
				All MARC records are proposed in MARC/XML format. For Java applications, they can be parsed by the <a href="https://github.com/marc4j/marc4j" target="_blank">MARC4J API</a>. 
				The FRBR files are provided in RDF/XML format. They have been generated using the Jena API. Thus, 
				the files can be parsed back by Jena to get the triples as POJOs. 
				The concepts used in the FRBR gold files use standards vocabularies <a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/" target="_blank">RDA</a> & <a href="http://iflastandards.info/ns/fr/frbr/frbrer/" target="_blank">FRBRer</a>. We also provide a
				<a href="https://github.com/bib-r/bib-r/blob/master/mappings.xml" target="_blank">mapping file</a> in RDF/XML where each concept used in the datasets can be mapped to another vocabulary. This file was also generated using the Jena API and can be parsed.
